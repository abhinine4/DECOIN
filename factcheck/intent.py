Brian Kemp, R-Ga.She spent a good portion of her interview with MSNBC anchor Ali Velshi on Saturday complaining about Georgia Republicansâ€™ supposed voter suppression initiatives and attempts to "game the system" to stay in power next election day, despite record early voting turnout across the state.
